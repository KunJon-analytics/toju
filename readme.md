# Toju Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Toju Project repository! This project is a result of my journey through the Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp. Toju is a decentralized platform built on top of the Sepolia testnet that facilitates global collaboration by allowing creators to fund their projects with TOJU tokens and supporters to contribute to their favorite content creators.

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- `frontend`: A Next.js application that serves as the user interface for interacting with the Toju platform.
- `backend`: A Hardhat project that houses the smart contracts, tests, and deployment scripts for the Toju platform.

## Features

- **Decentralized Funding:** Creators can fund their projects using TOJU tokens, enabling decentralized crowdfunding.

- **Support Content Creators:** Supporters can easily back their favorite content creators, fostering innovation and collaboration.

- **Minimized Risk:** Toju has been designed with a focus on minimizing risks for both creators and supporters.
